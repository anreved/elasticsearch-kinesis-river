Kinesis River Plugin for ElasticSearch
=========================

The Kinesis River Plugin is a river module for Elasticsearch that will process records for a particular AWS Kinesis stream
and bulk load them into the configured index.

The data from Kinesis can be in multiple formats, including:
1) As-Is
2) JSON
3) MessagePack



This is still a work-in-progress!
